Pinpoint (for Chrome)
====================

**Link anywhere.**

Pinpoint lets you create and share links to specific parts of a page. They're called pins, and they mean instead of leaving your friends lost at the top of a page, you can send them a link that will point them right at what you want them to see. Simply right click on anything you want to link to, and select "Create Pin". A picture, a paragraph, or anything else: Pinpoint takes you there.

Pinpoint is built based on the original Safari extension by [Shaun Inman](http://shauninman.com/archive/2011/07/25/cssfrag), currently maintained by [Karan Lyons](http://karanlyons.com/), following the proposal for [Using CSS Selectors as Fragment Identifiers](http://simonstl.com/articles/cssFragID.html) drafted by [Simon St.Laurent](http://simonstl.com/) and [Eric Meyer](http://meyerweb.com/).
